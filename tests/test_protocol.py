"""
Tests for the legacy wire protocol.

Two kinds of test live here:

* Ordinary correctness tests, so we can tell later whether an ML-KEM change
  broke the plumbing or the cryptography.
* Security tests that DEMONSTRATE the baseline system's weaknesses rather than
  guard against them. Those are marked with `security` and named so it is
  obvious they assert a flaw exists. They exist because the project brief asks
  us to show how problems were identified and verified - a passing test is
  much stronger evidence than a paragraph claiming a weakness is exploitable.
