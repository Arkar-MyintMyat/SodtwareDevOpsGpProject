"""
Tests for the edge gateway.

The unit tests cover the replay tracker and the stats counters. The
integration tests start a real GatewayServer on an ephemeral port, connect a
socket the way a device would, and replace the outbound HTTP call with a stub -
so the gateway's threading, framing and error handling are all exercised
without needing a running cloud service.
