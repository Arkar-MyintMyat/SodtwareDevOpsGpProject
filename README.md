# ML-KEM Legacy Modernization

Course project for *Software Development, Maintenance & Operations* (University
of Oulu): a simulated legacy device, an edge gateway, and a cloud service,
migrated to post-quantum key establishment (ML-KEM-768) on the gateway ↔ cloud
hop.

The baseline was built intentionally imperfect; its weaknesses are listed
below with their current status. The full migration and fallback reasoning
will be written up in `docs/architecture.md` (not yet written).

## Architecture

```
legacy_device  ---- TCP 9000, AES-128-CBC ---->  edge_gateway  ---- HTTP 8000 ---------------->  cloud_service
(Arduino-class,      hardcoded pre-shared key    (protocol        ML-KEM-768 handshake            (FastAPI,
 256-byte buffer,    no key establishment         translation,     + AES-256-GCM per reading       in-memory
 cannot be           unauthenticated              replay check)    (legacy path: --crypto legacy)  storage)
 re-flashed)         UNCHANGED - see below
```

The device hop stays legacy because the device cannot run ML-KEM: its public
key alone (1184 B) is over four times the device's 256-byte buffer, and the
firmware cannot be re-flashed. Post-quantum cryptography therefore terminates
at the gateway, which protects the long-haul hop - the one exposed to
"harvest now, decrypt later" recording.

| Component | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Legacy device | `legacy_device/` | Simulates a constrained sensor node. Sends an encrypted reading every N seconds. |
| Edge gateway | `edge_gateway/` | Terminates the legacy protocol, validates frames, forwards to the cloud over the ML-KEM channel. |
| Cloud service | `cloud_service/` | Holds the ML-KEM key pair, ingests readings, exposes `/health` and read APIs. |
| PQC channel | `pqc_channel/` | The handshake and message encryption shared by gateway and cloud. |

### The ML-KEM channel

Documented in full at the top of `pqc_channel/channel.py`. In short:

1. The gateway fetches the cloud's ML-KEM-768 public key and checks its
   SHA-256 fingerprint against the pinned value (`--cloud-key-fingerprint`).
2. It encapsulates to that key (proves it is talking to the real cloud) and
   sends a fresh one-time public key of its own (gives forward secrecy), plus
   an HMAC proving it knows the gateway token - the token itself is never sent.
3. The cloud decapsulates, encapsulates to the one-time key, and returns a
   confirmation tag. Both sides derive the keys from **both** shared secrets
   with HKDF-SHA256.
4. Every reading is then sealed with AES-256-GCM under the session key, with a
   per-session message counter as nonce (replays are rejected). Sessions last
   an hour or 10,000 messages.

**Fallback policy:** the gateway never falls back to the legacy path by
itself - that would let an attacker force a downgrade just by blocking the
handshake. Rolling back is an operator decision (`--crypto legacy`), and the
cloud can retire the legacy endpoint with `LEGACY_INGEST_ENABLED=false`.

The ML-KEM implementation is **kyber-py**, which is pure Python and **not
constant-time**. It is suitable for this course project, not for production;
swapping in liboqs would only change `pqc_channel/channel.py`.

## Requirements

* Python 3.11+
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running it

Three terminals, in this order.

**1. Cloud service**

`CLOUD_KEM_KEY_FILE` keeps the cloud's ML-KEM key pair across restarts (it is
created on first start; `.keys/` is git-ignored). Without it the cloud makes a
new key pair every start, and a pinned gateway will then refuse to connect.

```bash
# Git Bash / Linux / macOS
CLOUD_KEM_KEY_FILE=.keys/cloud_kem.json python -m uvicorn cloud_service.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

```powershell
# PowerShell
$env:CLOUD_KEM_KEY_FILE = ".keys/cloud_kem.json"; python -m uvicorn cloud_service.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

**2. Edge gateway**

Copy the fingerprint from the cloud's `/health` (`pqc.public_key_fingerprint`)
and pin it:

```bash
python -m edge_gateway.gateway --cloud-url http://127.0.0.1:8000 --cloud-key-fingerprint <fingerprint>
```

Without `--cloud-key-fingerprint` the gateway trusts the first key it sees and
logs a warning. `--crypto legacy` runs the old, unprotected cloud path.

**3. One or more devices**

```bash
python -m legacy_device.device --device-id dev-001 --interval 2
python -m legacy_device.device --device-id dev-002 --interval 2   # another terminal
```

## Checking that it works

Open the live dashboard: **<http://127.0.0.1:8000/>**. It refreshes every two
seconds and shows each device, the latest readings with an ML-KEM or legacy
badge, the share of readings delivered over ML-KEM, and the cloud's key
fingerprint (with a button to copy it for `--cloud-key-fingerprint`).

The raw JSON endpoints behind it:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/devices
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/telemetry?limit=5"
```

Each stored reading has a `channel` field (`mlkem` or `legacy`) showing which
path delivered it, and `/health` reports the ML-KEM fingerprint and the number
of active sessions.

Interactive API docs are served at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>.

## Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest              # all 99 tests
python -m pytest -m security  # only the tests that demonstrate weaknesses
```

| File | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/test_protocol.py` | Legacy wire format and its weaknesses |
| `tests/test_gateway.py` | Replay tracking, threading, framing |
| `tests/test_cloud.py` | Legacy ingest, validation, read APIs, dashboard |
| `tests/test_pqc_channel.py` | ML-KEM sizes, handshake, forward secrecy, AES-GCM tamper detection |
| `tests/test_pqc_integration.py` | Real gateway uplink against the real cloud: pinning, replay, tampering, session recovery, full device-to-cloud chain |

CI runs the whole suite on every push (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

Tests marked `security` deliberately assert that a weakness is real and
exploitable, rather than guarding against it. They are the evidence behind the
security findings in the report - for example
`test_finding_tampering_with_the_iv_rewrites_data_undetected` forges a reading
from a different device without knowing the key, which the gateway accepts as
valid.

## Baseline measurements

Taken **before** ML-KEM integration, so the report can show the real cost of
the migration rather than an unanchored number. 

```bash
python -m tools.baseline          # local measurements only
python -m tools.baseline --e2e    # also latency and throughput (services must be running) 
```

Results are written to `docs/measurements/baseline-<date>.json`. Re-run the
same script after ML-KEM integration with `--label mlkem` so both files
survive and can be compared.

Measured on 17 September 2026:

| Measurement | Legacy baseline |
| --- | --- |
| Frame on the wire | 98 B (28 B plaintext + 70 B overhead) |
| Device buffer used | 38.3% of 256 B |
| Key-establishment handshake | **0 B, 0 round trips** - the key is hardcoded |
| Key rotation supported | No |
| Encrypt per frame | 0.0058 ms median (~172,000 ops/s) |
| Decrypt per frame | 0.0059 ms median (~169,000 ops/s) |
| End-to-end latency, device to cloud | 9.7 ms median, 33.5 ms p95 |
| Sustained ingest | 105.5 readings/s |
| ML-KEM-768 handshake, projected | 2272 B, 1 round trip - **does not fit the device buffer** |

The zero-byte handshake is the headline figure: the legacy system is fast
precisely because it performs no key establishment at all.

### After ML-KEM integration

Measured on 24 September 2026, same laptop, both paths back to back
(`legacy-rerun-2026-09-24.json` and `mlkem-2026-09-24.json`, 50 latency
samples each):

| Measurement | Legacy path | ML-KEM path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Key establishment | 0 B, none | 4608 B raw (6497 B as JSON), 2 round trips, **~45 ms, once per session** |
| ML-KEM operations (kyber-py) | - | keygen 3.0 ms, encaps 3.8 ms, decaps 5.0 ms (median) |
| Reading on the wire, gateway to cloud | 75 B JSON | 221 B JSON (sealed + base64) |
| Seal one reading (AES-256-GCM) | - | 0.0025 ms |
| End-to-end latency, device to cloud | 26.4 ms median, 55.2 ms p95 | 17.0 ms median, 41.7 ms p95 |
| Sustained ingest | 85.7 readings/s | 83.8 readings/s |
| Forward secrecy / key rotation | No / No | Yes / Yes (hourly) |

How to read this honestly: the **same legacy code** measured 9.7 ms on 17 Sep
and 26.4 ms on 24 Sep, so run-to-run noise on a laptop is larger than
anything the per-reading cryptography adds. The ML-KEM path being lower in
this run is noise, not a speed-up. What the data does show: the per-reading
cost of AES-GCM is negligible, throughput is unchanged, and the real price of
the migration is a ~45 ms, ~6.5 KB handshake once per hour. The implemented
handshake is twice the earlier "projected" 2272 B because it uses two
encapsulations (one for authentication, one for forward secrecy).

## Wire protocol (legacy)

Each frame is one newline-terminated ASCII line:

```
<iv-hex>:<ciphertext-hex>\n
```

The plaintext inside is a pipe-delimited record:

```
DEV|<device_id>|<seq>|<temp_c>|<humidity>|<uptime_s>
```

A frame carrying a typical reading is 98 bytes, against a simulated device
buffer of 256 bytes. That headroom matters: see `docs/architecture.md` for why
it rules out running ML-KEM on the device itself.

## Known weaknesses of the baseline, and their status

The baseline weaknesses were deliberate; they were the work items for the
modernization.

1. **No key establishment.** One AES key is hardcoded in firmware and shared by
   the whole fleet. *Gateway ↔ cloud: fixed by ML-KEM. Device ↔ gateway:
   unchanged by design, accepted residual risk (the device cannot run ML-KEM).*
2. **Unauthenticated encryption.** AES-CBC without a MAC means tampering cannot
   be distinguished from corruption. *Gateway ↔ cloud: fixed by AES-256-GCM.
   Device ↔ gateway: unchanged, residual risk.*
3. **Static gateway token.** *Partly fixed: on the ML-KEM path the token is
   proved with an HMAC and never sent. It is still one shared secret for every
   gateway, with no rotation.*
4. **No transport security gateway -> cloud.** Plain HTTP. *Reading payloads
   are now protected by the ML-KEM channel; the read APIs and the legacy path
   are still plain HTTP.*
5. **No store-and-forward.** Readings are dropped if the cloud is unreachable.
   *Open.*
6. **In-memory storage only.** The cloud loses all data on restart. ML-KEM
   sessions are in memory too (gateways re-handshake automatically). *Open.*
7. **No containers or metrics endpoints yet.** *CI done; containers and
   metrics open.*
8. **Shared protocol module.** `edge_gateway` imports from
   `legacy_device.protocol`, which couples two separately deployable services.
   *Open for the legacy code; new shared code lives in its own `pqc_channel`
   package instead.*

New limitations introduced by the migration (to be covered in the report):

* **kyber-py is not constant-time** and is not intended for production.
* **Trust on first use** when the gateway is started without
  `--cloud-key-fingerprint` (demonstrated by
  `test_finding_unpinned_gateway_trusts_the_first_key_it_sees`).
* **The cloud's long-term private key is stored unencrypted** in
  `CLOUD_KEM_KEY_FILE`. Stealing it would allow impersonating the cloud to
  gateways, but thanks to forward secrecy would not decrypt past sessions.
* **ML-KEM only, not hybrid.** Security rests entirely on ML-KEM; a hybrid
  (X25519 + ML-KEM) design would stay secure if either one is broken.
