Cloud telemetry service.

WHAT THIS IS
    The far end of the chain. Gateways POST readings here; operators and other
    systems read them back. FastAPI generates an interactive API console at
    /docs from the type annotations below, which is how we demonstrate the
    system without writing a UI. 

WHY IT IS SHAPED LIKE THIS
    Small on purpose. The project brief asks us to keep the system plain, and
    the interesting work is the cryptography and the operations around it, not
    the data platform.

ITS ROLE IN THE MIGRATION
    This side holds the long-term ML-KEM-768 key pair. Gateways run the
    handshake in pqc_channel/channel.py against it and then send readings
    encrypted and authenticated with AES-256-GCM (the /api/v2 endpoints).

    Two ingest paths exist side by side during the migration:

        /api/v1/telemetry   legacy: plain JSON + static token header
        /api/v2/telemetry   ML-KEM session + AES-256-GCM

    The legacy path is switched off with LEGACY_INGEST_ENABLED=false once
    every gateway has been upgraded. Keeping it switchable, rather than
    deleting it, is the fallback strategy: an operator can roll a gateway
    back without redeploying the cloud. The gateway never falls back on its
    own - see edge_gateway/gateway.py.

KNOWN TECHNICAL DEBT (tracked in README.md)
    * Storage is an in-memory deque, so every reading is lost on restart.
    * Sessions are in memory too: a restart forces every gateway to redo the
      handshake (the gateway handles that automatically).
    * Gateways are identified only by one static shared token. It no longer
      crosses the network on the v2 path, but it is still shared and never
      rotates.
    * The long-term private key is stored unencrypted on disk.
    * Served over plain HTTP. v2 payloads are protected by the channel
      itself; v1 payloads and the read APIs are not.
    * No /metrics endpoint yet; only /health.

CONFIGURATION (environment variables)
    GATEWAY_TOKEN           shared gateway secret (default: legacy value)
    CLOUD_KEM_KEY_FILE      where the long-term ML-KEM key pair is kept. Created
                            on first start if missing. Unset means a new key
                            pair on every start - fine for tests, wrong for a
                            deployment, because pinned gateways then refuse it.
    LEGACY_INGEST_ENABLED   "false" disables /api/v1/telemetry (default "true")
