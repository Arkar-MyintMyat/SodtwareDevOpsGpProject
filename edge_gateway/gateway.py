"""
Edge gateway - the pivot of the whole modernization.

WHAT THIS IS
    A small Linux box physically near the devices. It terminates the legacy
    device protocol on one side and talks HTTP to the cloud on the other, with
    one thread per connected device.

WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL
    Devices this constrained cannot talk to the internet safely or efficiently:
    no TLS stack, no DNS, no retry logic worth the name. A gateway does that
    work on their behalf and aggregates many devices onto one uplink.

WHY IT MATTERS FOR THIS PROJECT
    The gateway is the only component in the chain that we can actually
    upgrade. The devices cannot be re-flashed, so post-quantum key
    establishment has to terminate here:

        device  --legacy AES-PSK-->  GATEWAY  --ML-KEM + AES-GCM-->  cloud
                  (never changes)    (upgraded)

    The gateway becomes a crypto-translating proxy. The long-haul hop - the one
    an attacker can realistically record today and decrypt in twenty years -
    becomes quantum-safe, while the short local hop stays legacy and is
    documented as accepted residual risk.

HOW IT TALKS TO THE CLOUD (--crypto)
    mlkem   (default) PqcUplink: ML-KEM-768 handshake, then every reading is
            sealed with AES-256-GCM. See pqc_channel/channel.py.
    legacy  LegacyUplink: the original plain JSON + static token path, kept
            only so an operator can roll back during the migration.

    FALLBACK POLICY: the gateway never switches from mlkem to legacy on its
    own. If the handshake fails, readings are counted as failed and dropped,
    exactly as when the cloud is down. An automatic fallback would let any
    attacker who can block the handshake force traffic back onto the weak
    path (a downgrade attack), which would defeat the migration. Falling back
    is a deliberate operator decision: restart with --crypto legacy.

WHAT IS STILL MISSING (known technical debt, tracked in README.md)
    * No store-and-forward queue: readings are lost when the cloud is down.
    * No TLS to the cloud. The v2 channel protects reading payloads itself,
      but the gateway's identity is still one static shared token (proved,
      not sent, on the v2 path).
    * Without --cloud-key-fingerprint the gateway trusts whichever cloud key
      it sees first (trust on first use), which a man in the middle present
      at that moment could exploit. Always pin in a real deployment.
    * Replay state is in memory only, so a restart forgets every sequence
      number and briefly drops traffic from devices that keep counting.
    * No /health or /metrics endpoint of its own yet - stats are only logged.

Run:
    python -m edge_gateway.gateway --cloud-url http://127.0.0.1:8000
    python -m edge_gateway.gateway --cloud-key-fingerprint <hex from cloud /health>
