"""
Simulated legacy edge device - an Arduino-class sensor node.

WHAT THIS IS
    A stand-in for real field hardware: a microcontroller with a temperature
    and humidity sensor, a few kilobytes of RAM, no operating system, and
    firmware written years ago by someone who has left.

WHY WE SIMULATE IT
    The project needs a component that genuinely cannot be upgraded, because
    that constraint is what makes the post-quantum migration interesting. A
    simulator lets us be precise about the limits (see MAX_FRAME_BYTES in
    protocol.py) instead of hand-waving about them.

WHAT IT MODELS FAITHFULLY
    * One hardcoded pre-shared key, no key establishment (see protocol.py).
    * A tiny receive buffer, enforced when building frames.
    * A retry-forever reconnect loop: field devices have nobody to report an
      error to, so they simply keep trying.
    * A monotonic sequence counter the gateway uses for replay detection.

WHAT IT DOES NOT MODEL
    Power budget, radio behaviour, clock drift, or flash wear. None of those
    change the cryptographic argument, so they are out of scope - the project
    brief asks us to keep this simple.

Run:
    python -m legacy_device.device --device-id dev-001 --interval 2
