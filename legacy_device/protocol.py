"""
Legacy wire protocol and cryptography for the simulated Arduino-class device.

WHAT THIS IS
    The frame format and encryption used on the device <-> gateway hop. Both
    ends of that hop import this module, so there is exactly one definition of
    the wire format.

WHY IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
    This module deliberately reproduces the weaknesses of the system we
    inherited. It is the BASELINE we are asked to modernize, not a target
    design. Do not copy this pattern into new code.

    Known weaknesses, all intentional (see README.md and docs/brief.html):

    1. The AES key is hardcoded below and shared by every device in the fleet.
       Extract it from one device and you can read all traffic, forever.
    2. There is NO key establishment. Nothing is negotiated, nothing rotates.
       This is the "outdated key-establishment mechanism" the project brief
       refers to, and the gap ML-KEM is meant to close.
    3. Frames are encrypted but NOT authenticated. AES-CBC gives
       confidentiality only, so a man-in-the-middle can modify traffic and the
       receiver cannot tell. tests/test_protocol.py proves this is exploitable
       rather than theoretical.
    4. Replay protection relies only on a plaintext sequence counter, which
       the gateway tracks in memory and loses on restart.

WHY WE KEEP IT ANYWAY
    The device cannot be re-flashed in the field, so this hop stays as it is
    for the life of the hardware. Our migration puts post-quantum cryptography
    on the gateway <-> cloud hop instead; see docs/architecture notes in the
    README for the justification.
